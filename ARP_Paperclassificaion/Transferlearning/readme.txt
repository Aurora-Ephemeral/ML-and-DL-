1. the main function is saved in "Transferlearning.mat". 

2. the default setting is for ResNet with the best preprocessing from rescaling the image to show the final result 

3. Running the first two step once is enough. For training of other network, please comment these two lines of code 

4. For the second use, please load the "224Test/Train/Validation.mat" or "227Test/Train/Validation.mat"

5. "model" folder contain the trained network by ourselves, you can directly use them 

6. "parameter" folder contains the weight of orignal network 

7. "result" folder contains the data set and result generated by ourselves 

8.  If yon has any question, please contact us directly.
